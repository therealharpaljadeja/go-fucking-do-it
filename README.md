# Go Fucking Do It

 - Have you ever felt the lack of motivation to complete a task? I am sure you do many times. 😔
 - Have you also come across situations where you performed way better than you actually thought of because if you don't you might lose something important? 😲
 - For example, completing an assignment at the last moment so you don't get fired. 😟
 - This is called "Fear Motivation". 
 - Fear is the most powerful motivator if used effectively.
 - But using fear for motivation is not possible for every task.
 - For example, learning a new skill.
 - So here is the solution, 
 
 - **"Go Fucking Do It" lets you create a task (I call it promise) with a deadline, a specified amount of crypto attached to it and a friend which acts a verifier (whether you completed your task or not). 🤩 **
 - **If you complete the task before the deadline let your friend verify it. If your friend approves you can request him/her to click "Fulfill" button corresponding to your promise (a.k.a task).** 
 - ***Once done, you will be refunded your funds.*** 
 - **But if you don't complete your task before the deadline either me or your friend can fulfill it but this time the funds will be funded to me.** 
 - ***Use this app as a fear motivator and get your tasks done!***
